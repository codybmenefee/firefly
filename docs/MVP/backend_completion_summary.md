# Backend Agent Task Completion Summary

## Overview
All backend tasks for the Firefly Tracker MVP have been completed. The backend is now ready for deployment and integration with the frontend.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Edge Functions Implementation
- **ping**: Health check endpoint (no auth required)
- **db-test**: Database connectivity test (no auth required)
- **sightings**: Full CRUD operations with authentication and authorization
  - POST: Create new sighting with location anonymization
  - GET: List sightings (with privacy filters) or get specific sighting
  - PUT: Update sighting (owner only)
  - DELETE: Delete sighting (owner only)
- **neighborhoods**: Read operations for neighborhood data
  - GET: List neighborhoods with optional city/state filters
  - GET by ID: Get specific neighborhood

### 2. Authentication & Security
- JWT validation middleware implemented in all protected endpoints
- Proper error handling for missing/invalid tokens
- CORS headers configured for all endpoints
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented for database tables
- Owner-only operations enforced for sighting updates/deletes

### 3. Database Schema & Migrations
Created three migration files:
- `20240607_create_sightings_and_neighborhoods.sql`: Base tables
- `20240608_create_storage_bucket.sql`: Photo storage configuration
- `20240609_add_rls_policies.sql`: Security policies

Tables created:
- **sightings**: All sighting data with location tracking
- **neighborhoods**: Neighborhood reference data
- **storage.buckets**: Photo storage configuration

### 4. Storage Configuration
- Created `firefly-photos` bucket for image uploads
- Configured file size limit (50MB) and allowed MIME types
- Set up storage policies for authenticated uploads

### 5. Documentation
- Updated `/docs/MVP/api_endpoints.md` with complete endpoint documentation
- Created `/supabase/DEPLOYMENT.md` deployment guide
- Created `.env.example` files for both frontend and backend
- Added seed data file for initial neighborhoods

### 6. Location Anonymization
- Implemented location-to-neighborhood mapping in sightings endpoint
- Public API responses hide exact coordinates for privacy
- Users can only see exact coordinates for their own sightings

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Set up Supabase Project**:
   - Create account at supabase.com
   - Create new project
   - Copy project URL and keys

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp supabase/.env.example supabase/.env
   # Edit with your project values
   ```

3. **Deploy Database**:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   npx supabase db push
   ```

4. **Deploy Functions**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/ping
   curl https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/db-test
   ```

## Frontend Integration Notes

The frontend team will need:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Anonymous key for client-side auth
- API endpoint documentation in `/docs/MVP/api_endpoints.md`
- Authentication flow using Supabase Auth SDK

All endpoints return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes and CORS headers enabled for browser compatibility.
